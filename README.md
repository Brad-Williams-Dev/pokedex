# Pokedex Application

The Pokedex application is a web-based tool developed using the React framework and the TailwindCSS utility-first CSS framework. It allows users to access information about various Pokémon species, such as their physical attributes, abilities, and weaknesses. All data in this application is sourced from the PokeAPI, which provides real-time information on the latest Pokémon releases.
